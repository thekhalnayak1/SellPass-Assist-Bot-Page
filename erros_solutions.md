# Common Erros

## Error 404 - Missing Setup

 To fix this error, an admin of the server must perform the bot setup (/setup). If the setup has already been performed, it is recommended to delete the data from the bot with /delete and perform the bot setup again

## Error: 400 - Request Error

 If this error occurs, something has gone wrong between the connection of the bot and sellpass. Do the following to possibly fix the error:
 - Delete the bot on your server with /delete
 - Renew your API token on sellpass. Go to the link https://dashboard.sellpass.io/settings/security & click on New API key.
 - Run the setup again and use the command again
 - The error should be fixed
