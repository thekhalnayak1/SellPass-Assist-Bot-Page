## Using the Bot

We strongly recommend using this bot on only one server at a time. The bot is designed to provide optimal support for a single server, and using it on multiple servers simultaneously may lead to various issues. To stay updated on the bot's status and features, regularly check the command `/botinfo`. We advise exclusively using the Beta and Releases versions, as the Developer Version may not always function correctly. For the latest updates, you can visit this link.
