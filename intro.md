# SellPass Assist Bot 

> Elevate your shop/discord potential with our versatile bot â€“ your all-in-one solution for seamless shop management, powerful integrations, and endless possibilities!

## Bot Setup

1) First you have to add the bot to your desired server. [Click me to invite](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1208759133868662784&permissions=8&scope=bot+applications.commands)
2) Before you can start with the setup you have to get your Sellpass API Token. You can find it in your account setting. [Click here to get to your token](https://dashboard.sellpass.io/settings/security)
3) Now you can start with the setup! Use `/setup` and insert the Sellpass API token. (Nobody will see this command & the response and therefore your token will not be seen by other users)
4) Now the bot will show you all stores that are connected to your account. Choose the store you want to use and enter it in the chat! Don't worry, users can't do anything with your store id, so it's not a risk to write it in the chat
5) Now the bot is ready to make your life on your Discord server easier.
6) (Optionally) With `/set_customerrole` you can give your users the possibility to claim the customer role after a purchase
